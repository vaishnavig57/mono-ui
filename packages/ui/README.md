## ðŸ“¦ How to Install This Package from GitHub (No npm Publish Required)

**If your package.json is at the root of the repo:**
```sh
npm install git+https://github.com/vaishnavi57/mono-ui.git
```
Or in your `package.json`:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "mono-ui": "git+https://github.com/vaishnavi57/mono-ui.git"
}
```

**If your package is in a subdirectory (e.g., packages/ui):**
```sh
npm install https://gitpkg.now.sh/vaishnavi57/mono-ui/packages/ui
```
Or in your `package.json`:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "mono-ui": "https://gitpkg.now.sh/vaishnavi57/mono-ui/packages/ui"
}
```

**For private repos:**
- Add your GitHub token to `.npmrc`:
  ```
  //github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
  ```
- Or use the token in the URL (not recommended):
  ```sh
  npm install git+https://<TOKEN>@github.com/vaishnavi57/mono-ui.git
  ```

**Required changes:**
- Make sure your build output (e.g., `dist/`) is committed to GitHub, or add a `prepare` script in your `package.json`:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "npm run build"
  }
  ```
- Ensure all peer dependencies (like `react`, `react-icons`, etc.) are installed in the consuming project.

**After install, import components as:**
```js
import { Search, Dropdown, LoginForm } from 'mono-ui';
```
_Replace 'mono-ui' with the name in your package.json if different._

## Notes
- Use `npm link` only for local development. For deployment/production, always use `npm install` from npm or GitHub.
- Rebuild (`npm run build`) your UI package after making changes to see updates in your linked project.
- Restart your local project's dev server after linking or installing.
- If you encounter issues, check your package name and import paths.

## ðŸš€ How to Publish to GitHub Packages and Use in Another Project

### 1. Publish Your Package to GitHub Packages

1. Make sure your `package.json` has:
   ```json
   "name": "@vaishnavi57/mono-ui"
   "publishConfig": { "registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com" }
   ```
2. In your `packages/ui/.npmrc` file, add:
   ```
   @vaishnavi57:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
   //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```
   *(Replace `YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your real GitHub token)*
   
   **Important:** Add `.npmrc` to your `.gitignore` file so you don't accidentally commit your personal access token to your repository.
3. Run these commands in `packages/ui`:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   npm publish
   ```
